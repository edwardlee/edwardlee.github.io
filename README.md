**Edward Lee** (Korean: 이진우; Hanja: 李振宇; born May 10), known professionally as Edward or just Ed, is an American second-year student at Carleton College. Currently pursuing computer science, with a focus on full stack, quant trading, and quantum computing, he is looking for the best players in the sector to join for the summer of 2021.

## Early life

Edward was born in the American state of Illinois. At an early age, Edward became interested in firefighters and inventors, and naturally took on soccer and piano lessons in his elementary years. Throughout his public schooling he picked up additional sports including basketball and track and field, earning modest regional recognition for his performance in the latter. Scratch served as Edward's introduction to computer programming and he made his début on the platform in 2010. His earliest projects were 2D games and animation sequences. Notably, [his take on Angry Birds](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2312360) continues to generate positive engagement.

## Career

#### Software Engineer Intern @ Talklet – _Fall 2020_
Rehauling MongoDb/Express/React/Node (MERN) application for production, specializing on new backend features, ex. porting [calendar package](https://github.com/Tim1023/react-scheduler-firebase) from Firebase to Mongo and leading its integration into the site.

#### Program Staff @ Concordia Language Villages (숲속의 호수) – _Summers 2019 & 2020_
A foreign language camp counselor, using all means necessary to entertain and educate young campers. Some of the best student coding projects under Edward's instruction live [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/supho/).

#### Software Engineer Intern @ HYLA Mobile – _Summer 2018_
Built a chatbot and performed data analytics for [Lori](https://www.hellolori.com/)—a smart(er) phone protection startup project. Some of the technologies Edward used on his own accord to streamline his workflow include Python, Mocha, Node, and popular natural language APIs.

### Social good
To Edward, coding and the usage of computers has always meant a source of joy and a medium to produce works of personal expression and identity. As long as he was a learner, he was also a teacher to his family, friends, and the public. Prior to entering high school he was involved in Code Phreaks, previously the Chicago Game Design Club, as a mentor and instructor for inner-city kids without the resources at home to experience the space of robotics and game design.

Beginning in 2017, he funneled this drive into BinaryHeart, a student-run NPO repurposing electronics, that otherwise would be discarded, for use by students in need. He now resides on the executive board, managing the [open-source org codebase](https://binaryheart-co.github.io/), and is rumored to be waiting eagerly until operations can resume in-person again.
