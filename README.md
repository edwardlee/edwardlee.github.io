**Edward Lee** (born May 10), sometimes known professionally as just Ed, is an American fourth-year student at Northwestern University. He is actively looking for a full time job, particularly those where writing code is involved.

## Early life
Edward was born in the American state of Illinois. As a child, Edward was interested in firefighters and dumplings and was influenced to become a software engineer after receiving praise for [his rendition](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2312360) of Finnish developer Rovio's "Angry Birds" during 5th grade. Edward applied and was hired by HYLA Mobile as a high school junior in Chicago in 2018.

## Other ventures
### Foreign affairs
In 2007, Edward entered as a trainee for a Korean traditional drumming troupe, and grew up performing across the country. Korean culture, especially Korean television, is his passion. Yet, foreign cultures remain his ultimate fascination. During his quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he learned every capital in the world.

Edward has academic backgrounds in Spanish, Latin, Japanese, Attic Greek, and Italian. In September 2022, he announced he achieved a 500 day streak on Duolingo.

### Philanthropy
To Edward, coding and the usage of computers has always meant a source of joy and a medium to produce works of personal expression and identity. As long as he was a learner, he was also a teacher to his family, friends, and the public. Prior to entering high school he was involved in Code Phreaks, previously the Chicago Game Design Club, as a mentor and instructor for inner-city kids without the resources at home to experience the space of robotics and game design.

Beginning in 2017, he funneled this drive into [BinaryHeart](https://binaryheart.org/), a student-run nonprofit organization repurposing electronics, that otherwise would be discarded, for use by students in need.
