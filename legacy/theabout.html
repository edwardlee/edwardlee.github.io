<h1>This website is <em>totally</em> Edward's. Who ever said it wasn't?</h1>
<body id="un">
<p>Edward is a cool kid who made his own website hosted by Google Drive. He made this webpage about himself at school after he had finished the PARCC test.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Edward is pretty old. He also tends to refer to himself in the third person when writing formal documents. You can visit his Google+ profile (Yes, he uses Google+. It is his primary social networking service) at <a style=text-decoration:none; href="https://plus.google.com/114811474656508769913/about">this link</a>. He would appreciate you if you added him to your circles. And just because, his best 400m time is 66.7 seconds. Also just because, he got a second place medal for Disease Detectives and a third place metal for Game On at the Loyola Science Olympiad invitational. Edward is kool! (that was my first Snapchat username, which lasted a few hours, after which I decided to change it since it was just weird.) And just as a miscellaneous comment, Edward got a first place ribbon for the eight-person competition at a regional math competition at Niles West High School. It is blue.</p>
